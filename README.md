## Supervised Machine Learning.
## 1. Defining the question.
Which individuals among a blog’s audience are likely to click on ads within the blog?

## 2. Defining the metrics of success
The analysis will be declared a success once we get the characteristics of individuals who are more likely to click on ads.

## 3. Defining the context.
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ your services as a Data Science Consultant to help her identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning.
## 1. Defining the question and context.
Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.

Perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations. Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis.

## 2. Defining the metrics of success
The analysis will be a success once we have gotten the clusters that the records belong to.

## 3. Experimental Design.
